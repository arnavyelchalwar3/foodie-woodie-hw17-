        Pizza (Italian: [Ààpittsa], Neapolitan: [Ààpitts…ô]) is a dish of Italian origin 
        consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped 
        with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as various 
        types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.),
         which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] 
         A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as 
         a pizzaiolo.
