   <div class="div-1"> Biryani (/b…úÀêrÀàj…ëÀêni/) is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent as a variety of Persian pilaf. 
    It is made with Indian spices, rice, and usually some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, fish) or in some cases without 
    any meat, and sometimes, in addition, eggs and potatoes.[1]
   Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia, as well as among the diaspora from the region. Similar dishes are also 
   prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.[2] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on 
   Indian online food ordering and delivery services and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.[3][4]
